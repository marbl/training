Repo for misc scripts shared within the lab. Anything is expected to be run on biowulf, so modules and absolute paths are OK (better use modules for tools when possible).
Put here everything you think may be somehow useful within the lab. No requirements on code quality, documentation or usability - just let it be the place for the latest available version of your scripts.

Feel free to add & modify anything in the structure except unsorted - this is reserved for those stuff that you are not ready to structure now but still suppose somehow useful for others.
Will make it a private github repo, plan to move to labs github if we'll find all this useful.
