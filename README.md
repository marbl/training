For a more detailed, general genome assembly tutorial, please refer to [this excelent material](https://github.com/human-pangenomics/hprc-tutorials/tree/GA-workshop/assembly/genomics_aotearoa/pages). The material was developed for a 3-day workshop to share genome assembly and evaluation strategies used by the HPRC, at Genomics Aotearoa. It covers a veriety of details that won't be covered in our workshop.
